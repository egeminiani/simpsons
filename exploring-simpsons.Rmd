# Introduction 
&nbsp;

The Simpsons is the world's longest-running animated sitcom, and it was created by the American writer Matt Groening. It is a satirical depiction of the working-class life of the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and it parodies culture, society, and the human condition.

This report illustrates an exploratory and text analysis of the many data sets about the show available at the data science platform [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/the-simpsons-dataset) and the \#tidytuesday [Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-08-27). Let us start by loading the required packages.

  x
}

colors  <- c('#fed41d', '#0094c7', '#f14e28')

The five data sets we will be working with are `simpsons_characters.csv`, `simpsons_locations.csv`, `simpsons_script_lines.csv`, `simpsons_episodes.csv`, and `simpsons-guests.csv`. 

```{r read_data}
characters <- read_delim("Data/simpsons_characters.csv", delim = ",")
locations  <- read_delim("Data/simpsons_locations.csv", delim = ",")
episodes   <- read_delim("Data/simpsons_episodes.csv", delim = ",")

```

# Pre-processing {.tabset  .tabset-pills}

Before starting with the actual analysis, it is convenient to perform the following pre-processing operations.

* `characters` data set: the levels of `gender` are recoded as `Male`, `Female`, and `Unknown`. 
* `dialogues` data set: we retain the speaking lines and create identifiers for the row number.
* `episodes` data set: we create a variable denoting the episode number: the format of the episode number follows the rules described  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_guest_stars) (i.e., the first number refers to the order it aired during the entire series, and the second number refers to the episode number within its season). We also filter the `episodes` until season 27, since the information about season 28 is partial (there are only 4 episodes).
* `guests` data set: the Movie seasons are excluded, and a logical variable `self` is created, which is equal to `TRUE` if a given guest star has played themselves in a particular episode, and `FALSE` if they have instead voiced a regular character. Some additional recoding on specific character names is carried out.

```{r processing}
characters <- characters %>% 
  mutate(gender = fct_explicit_na(gender, na_level = "Unknown"),
         gender = fct_recode(gender, Male = "m", Female = "f"))

dialogues  <- dialogues %>% 
  filter(speaking_line) %>%
  mutate(line_number = row_number()) %>%
  select(line_number, episode_id, number, role = raw_character_text,
         location = raw_location_text, line = spoken_words)

episodes   <-  episodes %>% 
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(part1 = sprintf("%03d", id), 
         number_in_season = sprintf("%02d", number_in_season)) %>%
  unite("part2", c(season, number_in_season), sep = "", remove = FALSE) %>%
  unite("number", c(part1, part2), sep = "â€“", remove = FALSE) %>%
  filter(season <= 27) %>%
  select(season, number, episode_id = number_in_series, prod_code = production_code, 
         year = original_air_year, title, rating = imdb_rating, 
         votes = imdb_votes, views, us_views = us_viewers_in_millions)

guests <- guests %>%
  filter(!season %in% "Movie") %>%
  mutate(season = parse_number(season)) %>%
  separate_rows(role, sep = ";\\s+") %>%
  mutate(self = str_detect(role, "self|selves"),
         role = ifelse(role == "Edna Krabappel", "Edna Krabappel-Flanders", role),
         role = ifelse(role == "Fit Tony", "Fat Tony", role)) %>%
  rename(title = episode_title, prod_code = production_code)
```

We can now look at the pre-processed data sets `characters`, `locations`, `episodes`, `dialogues`, and `guests`.

## Characters
```{r}
show_table(characters, caption = "Characters data set (first 50 rows)", scroll = TRUE)
```

## Locations
```{r}
show_table(locations, caption = "Location data set (first 50 rows)", scroll = TRUE)
```

## Episodes
```{r}
show_table(episodes, caption = "Episodes data set (first 50 rows)", scroll = TRUE)
```

## Dialogues
```{r}
show_table(dialogues, caption = "Dialogues data set (first 50 rows)", scroll = TRUE)
```

## Guests
```{r}
show_table(guests, caption = "Guests data set (first 50 rows)", scroll = TRUE)
```

# {-}

Let us join into `dialogues` the information contained in both `characters` and `episodes`. This will allow us to know, for instance, the gender of the characters who talk the most, and the season of each episode. Notice that since `dialogues` terminates at episode 568 (episode 16 of season 26), the joined data set will also terminate at episode 568, even if `episodes` actually ends at episode 596 (episode 22 of season 27). Because the join for episodes 160, 161, 173 produced NAs, we manually inserted their season number (8).

```{r joining1}
dialogues <- dialogues %>%
  left_join(characters, by = c("role" = "name")) %>%
  mutate(gender = fct_explicit_na(gender, na_level = "Unknown")) %>%
  left_join(episodes[,c("season", "episode_id")], by = "episode_id")

dialogues <- dialogues %>%
  mutate(season = ifelse(is.na(season), 8, season)) %>%
  select(line_number, season, number = episode_id, location, role, gender, line)
```

We now join into `episodes` the information from `guests`. This will be useful to get, for instance, the guest star name of each episode (if any), and the role they played. Since `episodes` terminates at episode 596 (last episode of season 27), the joined data set also terminates at episode 596, even if `guests` terminates at episode 662 (episode 23 of season 30). 

```{r joining2}
episodes <- episodes %>%
  left_join(guests, by = c("number", "season", "prod_code", "title")) %>%
  mutate(guest = ifelse(!is.na(role), TRUE, FALSE))
```

Lastly, we tidy the `dialogues `, which puts the speaking lines into a one-word-per-row format.

```{r tidy}
dialogues.tidy <- dialogues %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, line)
```

# Characters {.tabset  .tabset-pills}

<div style="clear: right">
The Simpsons is known for its vast ensemble of leading and supporting characters. The `characters` data set collects the names of 6722 characters that appeared throughout the seasons. In 95% of the cases, the gender of the character is not recorded. However, this is not problematic since those characters are not particularly relevant to the development of the show, as they only account for about 15% of the whole dialogues.
</div> 

## Frequency distribution

```{r gender_frequency}
frequency_table <- function(df, group_var, align = NULL, prop = TRUE, head = nrow(df),
                            caption = ""){
  group_var <- enquo(group_var)
  col.names <- c(firstup(as_label(group_var)), "Frequency")
  
  table <- df %>%
    group_by(!! group_var) %>%
    summarize(n = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(n))
  
  if(prop){
    col.names <- c(col.names, "Proportion")
    table <- table %>%
      mutate(prop = n / sum(n), 
             prop = percent(prop)) %>%
      arrange(desc(prop))
  }
  
  table %>%
    show_table(col.names = col.names, align = align, head = head, caption = caption)
}

characters %>%
  frequency_table(gender, align = c("l", "r", "r"),
                  caption = "The gender of the Simpsons characters throughout 26 seasons")
```

## Contributions to dialogues

```{r percentage_gender}
dialogues.tidy %>%
  frequency_table(gender, align = c("l", "r", "r"),
                  caption = "How each gender contributes to the dialogues of 26 seasons")
```

# {-}

The Simpsons is characterized by a marked gender imbalance, which is also reflected in the show's writing staff. More than 75% of the characters with recorded gender are male. The only female leading characters are Marge and Lisa Simpson. In contrast, among the supporting cast, we find Edna Krappabel-Flanders (the teacher at Springfield Elementary School), and Marge's older sisters, the twins Selma and Patty Bouvier.

<!-- # Guest stars {.tabset  .tabset-pills} -->

<!-- In addition to the show's regular cast of voice actors, celebrity guest stars have been a staple of The Simpsons, since its first season. Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists. -->

<!-- The `guests` data set contains information about the guest stars that took part in every episode, and the role they played. Let us have a look at the most recurring guest voices and roles. -->

<!-- ## Most frequent guest stars -->

<!-- The most frequent role voiced by guest stars is the teacher Edna Krabappel played by Marcia Wallace, followed by the actor Troy McClure played by Phil Hartman, and the gangster Fat Tony played by Joe Mantegna. -->

<!-- # Text analysis -->

<!-- Let us do some text analysis on the `dialogues` data set. In this case, the episodes of the show will act as the documents of our corpus. -->

<!-- ## Word and document frequency -->

<!-- Let us first remove the stop words from `dialogues`. -->

<!-- ```{r stop_words} -->
<!-- dialogues.tidy <- dialogues.tidy %>% -->
<!--   anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Let us find the most frequent words. By choosing a distinct combination of role, word, and line number we are preventing from counting the same word from the same line multiple times. It seems that the most recurrent words are for characters addressing each other.  -->

<!-- ```{r word_counts} -->
<!-- dialogues.summarized <- dialogues.tidy %>% -->
<!--   distinct(role, line_number, word) %>% -->
<!--   count(role, word, sort = TRUE) -->

<!-- dialogues.summarized %>% -->
<!--   show_table(head = 15, col.names = c("Character", "Word", "Frequency"), -->
<!--              align = c("l", "r", "r")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Let us now compute the term frequency (tf),  the inverse document frequency (idf), and their joint measure tf-idf, which finds the important words for each document, but not too common in the other documents. In this context, this translates to finding the peculiar words of a certain character, that are not generally used by the other characters. -->

<!-- ```{r specificity} -->
<!-- role.specificity <- dialogues.summarized %>% -->
<!--   group_by(role) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(total_words = sum(n)) %>% -->
<!--   ungroup() %>% -->
<!--   bind_tf_idf(word, role, n) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(desc(tf_idf)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can use the tf-idf as a catchphrase detector. We filter for those characters with many dialogues (specifically, more than 500 words), and keep one row for each character (to find a single peculiar word for every role). The following plot shows the words with the highest tf-idf with the associated characters. For some characters, the peculiar word is the name of the character they usually talk to (e.g., Smithers saying 'sir' or Agnes Skinner saying 'Seymour'), for others it is the word they use to introduce themselves (e.g., Troy McClure saying 'I'm Troy McClure'), or as recurring sounds (e.g., the Captain going 'Arrr' or Nelson 'haw'). -->

<!-- ```{r arrr, fig.height=7.5, out.width="600"} -->

<!--   filter(total_words >= 500) %>% -->

<!--        x = "", y = "TF-IDF") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Bigrams Analysis -->

<!-- Let us explore the most frequent bigrams, that is, the pairs of words that often occurr together. Among the most common bigrams, we find the family members 'homer simpson', 'bart simpson', and 'lisa simpson', followed by frequent onomatopoeia, like 'woo hoo' or 'hey hey'. -->

<!-- ```{r bigrams} -->
<!-- dialogue_bigram <- dialogues %>% -->
<!--   unnest_tokens(bigram, line, token = "ngrams", n = 2) -->

<!-- dialogue_filtered <- dialogue_bigram %>% -->
<!--   separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>% -->
<!--   filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word & !is.na(word1)) %>% -->

<!--   show_table(head = 10, col.names = c("Bigram", "Frequency"), -->
<!--              align = c("l", "r")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The following table shows the bigrams with the highest tf-idf that occurred more than 50 times. At the top, we find 'haw haw', the signature mocking laugh of Nelson, and 'kent broackman', for the TV announcer always going 'This is Kent Brockman'. -->

<!-- ```{r bigrams_tf_idf} -->
<!-- bigram_tf_idf <- bigram_united %>% -->
<!--   count(role, bigram) %>% -->
<!--   bind_tf_idf(bigram, role, n) %>% -->

<!--              align = c("l", rep("r", 5))) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Networks -->
<!-- The following network plot depicts the relationships across the bigrams that occurred at least 30 times. The biggest networks seem to revolve around the words 'simpson', 'dollars' and 'hoo'. -->

<!-- ```{r networks, fig.height=8, out.width="650"} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Sentiment Analysis -->

<!-- Let us now investigate which words most contribute to positive and negative sentiments.  -->

<!-- The following plot shows the most positive and negative words among those occurring at least 400 times throughout the seasons. The positive words with the highest contributions are 'love', 'wow' and 'nice', whereas among the negative ones we find 'bad', 'burns' and 'stupid'. The word 'burns' has been associated to a negative sentiment because it is seen as the third person of the verb 'to burn', which has a negative connotation. In the case of the Simpsons though, that word might simply refer to the character Mr. Burns. However, due to the evil and greedy nature of that character, the graph does not seem inaccurate after all! -->

<!-- ```{r sentiment,  fig.height=8, out.width="500"} -->
<!-- simpsons_sentiments <- dialogues.tidy %>% -->

<!-- Let us inspect the words that most contribut to the positive and negative sentiments for the 6 most talkative characters of the show. The characters generally share the same positive (e.g., 'love', 'nice', 'fine') and negative words (e.g., 'bad', 'wrong'). -->

<!-- ## Wordclouds -->

<!-- Let us now depict a wordcloud of the whole dialogues.  -->

<!-- ```{r wordcloud_global, fig.height=6, out.width="400", out.height="600"} -->
<!-- plot_wordcloud <- function(df, x, y, head = TRUE, head.size = 50,  -->

It would be interesting to depict a separate wordcloud for the most talkative characters of the show, to get an insight of their recurrent 'theme'. Besides the fact that the most recurrent words for each characters are the ones used for interacting with the other characters, we can define a broad theme revolving around school and friends for Bart and Lisa Simpson, the bar for the bar owner Moe, and the nuclear plant for Mr. Burns. -->

<!-- ## Topic Modelling -->

<!-- In this section, we analyze the term document matrix of `dialogues`. Considering the show episodes as the documents does not provide much insight, as we expect episodes to generally share the same themes. Therefore, we will consider as a document the lines said by a certain character. -->

<!-- To get more insightful resuls, we remove from `dialogues.tidy` some onomatopoeia, and when constructing the document term matrix, we keep those words occurring at least 20 times, and whose tf-idf is higher than the 80% quantile. -->

<!-- custom_stopwords <- stop_words %>% -->
<!--   add_row(word = c("hey", "gonna", "yeah", "uh", "ya", "ho", "la", "em", -->
<!--           "ah", "huh", "ooh", "gotta", "eh", "aw", "heh", "wow", -->

<!-- ```{r lda} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The plot below shows the 10 words that are most representative of each topic. It seems that the first topic is related to the simpsons and their social life (as indicated by the words 'moe' and 'beer'), whereas the second one to the simpsons, their children and family life (as indicated by the words 'dad' and 'homie'). Some words also appear on both topics, like 'homer', 'money' and 'god'. -->

<!-- We can now allocate each Simpson character to the topic for they are most likely to belong to. The following plot shows the gamma probabilities for the most talkative characters. Wylon Smithers is the character with the highest classification probability to topic 1. One of the most significant word for topic 1 was 'sir', which is indeed very often used by Smithers to address his boss Mr. Burns. Lisa Simpson, instead, has the highest probability of belonging to topic 2. -->
